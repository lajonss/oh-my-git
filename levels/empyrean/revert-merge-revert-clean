title = Merge revert apocalypse 2
cards = checkout reset-hard merge rebase push

[description]

What happened:
1. you've committed something
2. you've merged it into the remote branch
3. you've reverted the merge commit and pushed that to remote branch
4. you've added some more changes
5. you try to push the changes to remote branch, but something's wrong

What you want to do - get rid of the reverts.

You cannot push your changes after overwriting your history.
To force your history on origin use
    git push --force

[setup]

echo "beginning" > beginning
git add .
git commit -m beginning

echo "a change from remote" > a_change_from_remote
git add .
git commit -m "a change from remote"

git push origin main
git branch -u origin/main main

git checkout -b feature/my_changes HEAD~1

echo "first change from you" > first_change_from_you
git add .
git commit -m "first change from you"

git merge --no-edit origin/main

git checkout main
git merge feature/my_changes
git revert -m 1 --no-edit HEAD
git push

git checkout feature/my_changes
echo "second change from you" > second_change_from_you
git add .
git commit -m "second change from you"

[setup origin]

git checkout main
